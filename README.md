# PDF_Word_Searcher
A python based project to search for a specific word and return a list containing the name of PDF files where the word we search for is contained inside it.
Module used: "tkinter"(GUI), "pymupdf(fitz)" for PDF file processing, "os" (directory and saving file), "nuitka" to turn the python script into executable application with EXE format.

I made this application to fulfill my senior request ( im doing part time job in my univ library) to make a PDF search engine that wont connect to the internet for data protection.
